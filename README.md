# Discord Bot for Checking 2020 CBSE Results

I just quickly hacked together a Discord bot so that my friends and I could conveniently check our results and get images of the webpage. The main purpose was to get familiar with using Selenium.

## To-do:
Make the website-screenshotting code async. It currently blocks for each screenshot command.
This could eventually just become a web-site screenshotting bot.
